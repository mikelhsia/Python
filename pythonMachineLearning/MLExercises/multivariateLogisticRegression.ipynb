We just defined a cost function that says, in a nutshell, \"given some candidate solution theta applied to input X, how far off is the result from the true desired outcome y\". This is our method that evaluates a set of parameters. By contrast, the gradient function specifies how to change those parameters to get an answer that's slightly better than the one we've already got. The math behind how this all works can get a little hairy if you're not comfortable with linear algebra, but it's laid out pretty well in the exercise text, and I would encourage the reader to get comfortable with it to better understand why these functions work.\n",
