    "# <a href=\"http://blog.yhat.com/posts/the-beer-bandit.html\">Python Multi-armed Bandits (and Beer!)</a>\n",
    "The term multi-armed bandit comes from a theoretical problem where instead of one slot machine lever, you have a number of them, say three like in the image above. If you know the odds and payouts, it's trivial to determine the lever with the highest expected value. But imagine you didn't know the odds (like not knowing which model preforms best). A bandit algorithm attempts to solve this problem and maximize profit by systematically testing different levers and remembering the rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does this have to do with beer recommenders? What the analogy of a multi-armed slot machine captures well is it costs to test your hypotheses. A slot machine takes a coin to play. A website costs you a visit. Testing gains you knowledge, but will sometimes necessitate supplying your customers with an inferior product. In response, bandit algorithms are automated to move away from low scoring options and inherently prefer those that preform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course you can do this with an A/B test. And if you're only going to run one or two test over a short period of time which you track frequently, an A/B test will often perform just as well as a bandit algorithm. But as the number and length of hypotheses and tests increase, the advantage of an automatic feedback loop allows the designer to take a more hands off approach."

    "## Epsilon-Greedy\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, the epsilon-greedy algorithm does a good job of encapsulating the spirit of bandit algorithms. Every time the algorithm has to choose an option (also referred to as an arm), it first considers two possibilities; **explore** or **exploit**. Explore corresponds to testing, and if epsilon-greedy takes this path it simply chooses an arm at random. The exploit path on the other hand leads only to the arm with the best performance so far, the safe bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"best arm\" is considered the option (in our case a recommendation model) with the highest probability of reward. I'll define my feedback system later, but for now think of reward as akin to *clicks/views*. Below is a probabilistic diagram which expresses this behavior. Notice that once the system lands on the \"testing\" node, it's synonyms with generalized A/B testing.\n",
    "<img style=\"width:50%\" src=\"data/epsilongreedy.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Epsilon-greedy will choose to test with a frequency of epsilon (hence the name). An epsilon value of  will cause it to always test, while a value of  will cause it to always exploit the best preforming arm."
